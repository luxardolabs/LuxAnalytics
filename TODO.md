## ‚ùå Remaining Items

### Testing
- [ ] Add integration tests with mock server
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Add memory leak tests
- [ ] Add stress tests for queue overflow scenarios

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Create example app demonstrating best practices
- [ ] Add SwiftUI-specific examples
- [ ] Create migration guide for future versions

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add support for custom event transformers
- [ ] Add support for sampling (only send X% of events)

## üö´ Not Applicable (Backend SDK)

These items are not applicable to a backend SDK:
- App Tracking Transparency (host app responsibility)
- Privacy nutrition labels (host app responsibility)
- GDPR/CCPA UI consent management (host app implements UI, we just respect settings)
- Data portability UI (we provide the data, host app presents it)
- User-facing privacy policy (host app responsibility)

## Implementation Priority

1. **Testing** - Integration tests and benchmarks
2. **Developer Experience** - Example app
3. **Future Enhancements** - Based on user feedback

## Recent Changes (2025-07-06)

### Authentication Overhaul
- Removed HMAC-SHA256 authentication complexity
- Implemented simpler DSN-based configuration
- Single configuration string contains all connection info
- Basic Auth for secure, simple authentication
- Backward compatibility maintained through error handling

### Configuration Improvements
- Added Info.plist configuration support
- Simplified initialization with `initializeFromPlist()`
- Consistent example DSNs throughout documentation
- Better error messages for configuration issues
